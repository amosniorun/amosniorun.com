            <p>Ah, there you are.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>Something wrong?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>No, I... I simply wanted to check in after the unsettling events of the other day.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>I kinda try not to dwell on stuff like that, but I admit I'm having more trouble shrugging this off than
                usual.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>It's gonna make my life a lot harder if my powers end up being evil.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>Perhaps. And yet... Hmm, how do I put this?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Power is neutral. The good or evil of it comes from the one who wields it.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>For example, I possess extreme strength, and have always believed this gift was bestowed upon me so that
                I
                might protect others.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Happy"></portrait>
            <p>And you...used your power to save us, which means it cannot possibly be evil.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Happy"></portrait>
            <p>Didn't mean to fish for sympathy there, but... Well, thanks.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>My apologies if I overstepped.</p>

        <div class="quote-container hopes">
            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>Oh, Dimitri. Have you read that letter from your stepmom yet?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Ah, yes. I have.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>It was a missive requesting the then Viscount Elidure's cooperation in her conspiracy against my father.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>She claimed he would have much to gain from the king's elimination, all while shrewdly expressing
                sympathy
                with his objections to the reforms.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I had it investigated for signs of forgery as a precaution, but such a search returned nothing. The
                letter is
                authentic.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>Meaning your stepmom was a willing participant in the Tragedy of Duscur.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>She sent so many to dieâ€”and would've done the same to her own stepson, if all had gone according to plan.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>All out of desire to see her daughter again. Or so Cornelia said.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>The wretch's words deserve little weight...but I believe she spoke true.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>In every memory I hold of my stepmother, she was always looking past me. As if the one she truly cared
                for was somewhere else entirely.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Angry"></portrait>
            <p>That's horrible. I never knew my real mom, but the woman who adopted me loved me with all her heart.
                That's how it should be.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>It was horrible, yes, but what of it? There is no guarantee a parent will come to love their child.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>Still, being faced with such plain evidence of her crimes is a difficult thing to come to terms with.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>I had once thought her among those I would avenge, yet now she lies squarely in the path of my fury.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>Pretty heavy stuff, yeah.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I can tell you're troubled as well.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>You can see straight through me, huh? Guess that's what three years together will do.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>It's Myson, that dark mage from before. He was... familiar with my power somehow.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>And yeah, I know you said you trust me, but I'm not so sure I even trust myself anymore.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>I just can't stand not knowing the truth. Who am I, really?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>No matter what answer awaits, I will continue to place my trust in you. That hasn't changed.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>But what if I transform and attack you?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I would do whatever I must to restrain you, naturally. Failing that, I'd...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Sad"></portrait>
            <p>Forgive me. It helps no one to utter such words.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>It's fine. If nothing else, the threat of death is good motivation for me to get this power under
                control.</p>

            <portrait name="Arval/Shocked"></portrait>
            <p>Have you lost your mind? It almost sounds like you'd be OK with him killing you.</p>

            <portrait name="Shez"></portrait>
            <p>I don't wanna die, of course. But if it was between that and killing a friend, I know which one I'd pick.

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Professor... The possession of Relics and Crests has been highly valued in Faerghus since ancient times.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>It's far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they don't bear a
                Crest. Just like Miklan.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>It happened to my uncle as well. The eldest child of the king, and yet he never ascended to the throne.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>All families whose bloodlines carry the Crests of the 10 Elites are much the same.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>But House Gautier takes it a step further, and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a Crest.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>To that house, the power of Crests is a necessity, not a luxury.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>House Gautier holds the most northern territory in the Kingdom, and they have fought with the people to
                the north for many years.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>The head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders, whom they
                keep at bay with the power of Crests and Relics.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>In exchange for that responsibility, they are granted special privileges within the Kingdom.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I believe that Margrave Gautier was wrong to disinherit Miklan simply because he did not bear a Crest.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Still, there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in Crests...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Bloodlines that carry Crests would dwindle. The metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would
                eventually rust.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>This same argument has been made time and time again across the years. Both sides are at once right and
                wrong.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I believe those with Crests and those without should acknowledge the others' strengths and learn to
                respect each other based on personal merits.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>And that doesn't apply only to Crests. The same holds true for lineage, race, faith, ideologies...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>If we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions, one step at a time... Perhaps... Who
                knows if that's even possible.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Everyone has something that is unacceptable within them. I certainly do, and I'd wager you do as well.
            </p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I wonder which is best, Professor... To cut away that which is unacceptable, or to find a way to accept
                it anyway...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote-container timeskip">
            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>You're wrong.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>It's not like that, Glenn. I swear it. Any love I once had for my stepsister...has been tossed aside.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Only hatred remains. If I could tear that woman to shreds right this very moment, I would.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I don't care if she's the emperor. It's no different than killing anyone else. So I beg you...all of
                you... Do not worry about my resolve.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>Please, Father... And you too, Stepmother... Do not gaze at me with that look in your eyes...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri/Happy"></portrait>
            <p>I will bring you her head soon. And when I do, you may finally rest in peace. I know it... Yes, I know
                it...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>What do you want?</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>I see.</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>We should make haste and prepare to move out at once. I must kill her as soon as possible...</p>

            <portrait name="Dimitri"></portrait>
            <p>We have no time to leisurely set up camp. If I must, I will go by myself.</p>
